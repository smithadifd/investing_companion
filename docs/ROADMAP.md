## Notes & Recommendations

### Start Simple
- Phase 0+1 should be tight. Resist scope creep.
- Yahoo Finance free tier is sufficient for prototype.
- Skip Redis caching initially if it adds complexity (use in-memory).

### Data Source Strategy
- **Free tier first**: Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage (5 req/min)
- **Upgrade path**: Polygon.io starter ($29/mo) for real-time + more history
- **Fallback logic**: If one provider fails, try another

### AI Integration Tips
- Store API key encrypted in user_settings
- Default to Claude 3.5 Sonnet (best balance)
- Stream responses for better UX
- Include equity context (fundamentals, recent prices) in prompts
- Consider caching AI responses for repeated questions

### Home Server Considerations
- Use Traefik with Let's Encrypt for HTTPS
- Set up automatic backups (pg_dump to external drive)
- Consider Tailscale for remote access without port forwarding
- Monitor with Uptime Kuma or similar
